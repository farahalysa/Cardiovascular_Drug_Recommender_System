# Recommendation System with Content-Based Filtering Method in Cardiovascular Diseaseâ€™s Drugs
Cardiovascular disease is a group of heart and blood vessel disorders which are the leading cause of death globally. In Indonesia, about one third of all deaths are caused by cardiovascular disease. Prevention of premature death can be achieved by identifying patients who are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease and ensuring they get the right medication. In prescribing drugs, it is not uncommon for doctors or pharmacists to change prescription drugs when patients cannot take certain drugs due to allergies, side effects that cannot be tolerated, or when drug stocks run out. Therefore a cardiovascular drug recommender system is needed to provide relevant replacement drug recommendations. The analytical method used in this study is a recommender system with a content-based filtering method. Similarity between drugs is measured based on the similarity measure using cosine similarity. The data used in this project is sourced from the MIMS website https://www.mims.com/indonesia/drug
