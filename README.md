# Cardiovascular Drug Recommender System

Cardiovascular disease is a group of heart and blood vessel disorders that constitute the leading cause of death globally. In Indonesia, approximately one third of all deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease. Premature death prevention can be achieved by identifying high-risk patients and ensuring they receive appropriate medication.

In medical practice, it's common for doctors or pharmacists to alter prescriptions due to allergies, intolerable side effects, or drug shortages. Thus, a cardiovascular drug recommender system becomes crucial for providing relevant replacement drug recommendations.

## Methodology

This project employs a *recommender system* with a **content-based filtering** method. Drug similarity is measured using **cosine similarity**. The data utilized is sourced from the [MIMS website](https://www.mims.com/indonesia/drug).

## Implementation

The developed recommendation system has been implemented on a website, accessible [here](https://cvdsdrugrecommendersystem.pythonanywhere.com/). Feel free to explore and use the system to get personalized drug recommendations.
